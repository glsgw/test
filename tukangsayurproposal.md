## Introduction

***Tukang Sayur Co.*** currently has a an android application on the *google playstore*,
a social media presence (on the usual social media distribution channel), and a website that
displays only the product and a download link to the playstore. In a fundraising effort,
the client needs to show traction data (engagement, activity, retention, revenue stream / projection)
and growth hack in parallel of revenue stream.

The contractor party's role is to facilitate tools that will help determine client's needs to
plan and execute their short/long-term goal.

Project pre-requisites (*These services are free of charge and provided by a third party*):
- Git-based repository to host the project -- so the project lives on a remote server as well,
*this service is free of charge even for private repositories*.
([Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.com) / [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com)).
- Team commucation tool ([Slack](http://slack.com)).
- Simple Project management tool ([Trello](http://trello.com)).

Paid Project pre-requisites:
- DNS (domain).
- Amazon Web Services account (link credit card to AWS).
- Intercom (basic cohort analysis, not as extensive as Mixpanel, but it's a good start to measure engagement)
- Zendesk (optional) for email feedbacks and whatnot
- Mixpanel (for extensive cohort analysis, free trial first)

All paid project pre-requisites are at client's account.

This project consists of 3 major stages: (not necessarily in this order, but more of a guideline to facilitate the client's goals)
- Growth hack
- Data Crunching
- VC / Angel Kit

## Growth Hack

***User acquisition to determine cost per user acquisition vs. activity vs. action vs. dropoffs***

When it comes to growth it’s important to know how effective a product is at converting visitors to users and which channels are effective and bringing in new users. At this stage traction may look like a month over month growth of new visits of the product with an increase in activations/conversion from visitors to users.

For example does the product have 10k new visits each month that is growing by 10% and a conversion rate of 2%. With each month you can identify whether the work your team is doing is having a positive or negative impact.

Please note that not everything is done in sequence, this is merely a list.

**Analytical Tool Configuration**

1. Explore the database intensively and figure out current user base
2. Analyze user journey and flow.
3. Create Intercom account and start creating cohorts.
4. Integrate Intercom with website for tracking and support
5. Integrate Intercom with current android application to track actions, activity, longevity.

**Development**

1. Revamp website with a blog engine as a base for attracting signups and FAQ.
2. Create a portal for people to signup as agents and keep track of their orders (TBD).

**Growth**

1. Determine KPI (Key Performance Indicator).
2. Assist in managing campaign expectations based on on-going signup or user responses.
   This approach entails article campaigns, research on results per previous campaign,
   and also per metrics results.
3. Work closely with DM to do research on Community outreach (community management),
   to determine which channel works best to gain traction and / or validation, then
   execute.

Growth hack process is a forever on-going and an evolving process, the points mentioned
above serves merely as a guideline, action / action types may vary depending on progress and
traction.


## Data Crunching

***In parallel or after a certain milestone has been hit, especially
after data aggregation, it is the point where we analyze
current data to make marketing, product and business decisions***

At this stage, we need to determine whether to develop custom CMS for overview of current user data or stick with intercom exclusively.
We analyze feedback and real data to determine feature development or marketing development, which in turn will develop
into a roadmap of business and product.


## VC / Angel Kit

As the client reaches fundraising level, we will assist them in shaping the documents they need to approach, introduced to, and due diligence (on best endeavour basis. Sensitive materials such as valuation, internal finance is at the client's discretion).

We could assist in:

- Pitch deck (slide deck)
- Data Visualization
- VC Intro and / or Angel intro. (on best endeavour basis without guarantee)**

In essence, the list below should help visualize what needs to be done before even considering making an intro to a VC / Angel.

- Your Vision - Your most expansive take on why your new company exists.
- The Problem - What are you solving for the customer–where is their pain?
- The Customer - Who are they and perhaps how will you reach them?
- The Solution - What you have created and why now is the right time.
- The (huge) Market you are addressing - Total Available Market (TAM) >$1B if possible. Include the most persuasive evidence you have that this is real.
- Market Landscape - including competition, macro trends, etc. Is there any insight you have that others do not?
- Current Traction - list key stats / plans for scaling and future customer acquisition.
- Business model - how users translate to revenue. Actuals, plans, hopes.
- Team - who you are, where you come from and why you have what it takes to succeed. Pics and bios okay. Specify roles.
- Summary - 3-5 key takeaways (market size, key product insight, traction)
- Fundraising - Include what you have already raised and what you are planning to raise now. Any financial projections may go here as well. You can optionally include a summary product roadmap (6 quarters max) indicating what an investment buys.
